# Roadmap

This repository contains the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) of all features that planned for implementation in [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot).

In the [roadmap file](ROADMAP.md), all the goals are listed. These are features that are planned and approved for implementation by the core developers and contributors.

Feature proposals should be discussed in the [Godot proposals](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals) repository, not in this repository's issue tracker.

### Q) Why not Kanban, Trello, Issues, etc?

In open source projects, developers work on their free time and, at their own pace, and out of pure motivation. Setting goals and deadlines is not compatible with this methodology, as things get done when they get done. Because of this, the aim of this document is to just list and discuss the ideas.
